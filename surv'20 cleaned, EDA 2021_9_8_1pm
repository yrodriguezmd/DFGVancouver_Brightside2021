# 0 = other, 1 = Vancouver  --> most were from Vancouver

Findings:
Most tenants are Canadian-born, aged >55, female, single and living by themselves.

Most are retirees, not doing volunteer work.

Majority were not worried about food. They had acceptable neighbourly social interactions and generally felt content and safe.

Most tenants were previously renting from private companies in Vancouver and are now long-term Brightside clients who think that Brightside is approachable.

Limitations:
Findings might be skewed by representation bias.
