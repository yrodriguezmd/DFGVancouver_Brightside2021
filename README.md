### DFGVancouver_Brightside2021

#### Datathon with Data For Good Vancouver, in cooperation with Brightside

Helped in the initial analysis of Brightside housing data.  Focused on crime rates per Vancouver neighbourhood.  Merged crime rates data with housing amenities data per housing building.

Plenty of room for further EDA and predictive analysis.
